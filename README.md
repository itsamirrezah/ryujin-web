## Ryujin-web

Ryujin is a web-based multiplayer game inspired by the popular board game [Onitama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onitama). Ryujin brings the tactical challenges of Onitama to the online arena where players take on the role of ancient Japanese martial artists, competing to capture their opponent's master while defending their own.
